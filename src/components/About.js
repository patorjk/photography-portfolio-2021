      'Year 7 (2022): They cut off the top of my tree! Sadly I read online that these trees typically only live 15-20 years ðŸ˜­, though they can live over 100 with proper care - so hopefully the park service is able to save this one. However, I\'ve decided I\'m going to continue on even if the tree dies.',
      // eslint-disable-next-line max-len
      'Year 6 (2021): This is almost the prefect shot (in my mind). With this shot I feel like I finally figured out how to nail the lighting. The only problem is the top of the tree is dying. You can see it start to die in 2020.',
      // eslint-disable-next-line max-len
      'Year 5 (2020): The pandemic was just going into full swing and I felt bad just showing up, but after the previous year I felt I should try. This is kind of a crummy shot, but it goes along well with the year. Behind me is the stump of the tree I talked about in the previous 2 shots.',
      // eslint-disable-next-line max-len
      'Year 4 (2019): Another nice morning. This whole section was roped off by the park service (they had just removed the tree I mentioned in Year 3) and I briefly thought of discontinuing the tradition, but it seemed like a shame to kill it off so unceremoniously so I stepped over the ropes and quickly took this shot. Thankfully I didn\'t get in trouble.',
      // eslint-disable-next-line max-len
      'Year 3 (2018): This was the year it became a tradition. It was a nice morning and I saw the spot again and was like "I\'m doing it!" My only regret is that I framed the shot to include the dying tree that\'s almost directly behind me (in Year 5 you can see this tree\'s stump behind me - they removed it prior to Year 4\'s blossoms). This may be the best year for the main tree\'s blossoms. After Year 4 this tree starts to decline (though maybe it\'ll make a come back?).',
      // eslint-disable-next-line max-len
      'Year 2 (2017): This was the year a freeze killed many of the blossoms. It was a pretty "meh" morning and I wasn\'t getting many good shots. I saw this spot again and decided to recreate my shot from the previous year just for fun.',
      // eslint-disable-next-line max-len
      'Year 1 (2016): Technically this was my second year in a row visiting the Cherry Blossoms, but it was the first where I really knew what I was doing photography-wise and it was a really nice morning. My best shots of the area are from this day. Anyway, it was so nice I decided to do a self portrait next to the branches of this one particular tree.',

            My name is Pat, I'm a software developer and amateur photographer. I setup this site to show off some of my favorite photos. If you're interested in more of my work you can find me on <Link href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/40423570@N07/' target='_blank'>Flickr</Link> and <Link href='https://www.instagram.com/patorjk/' target='_blank'>Instagram</Link>.

            Additionally, I run a programming site which you can find here: <Link href='https://patorjk.com/' target='_blank'>patorjk.com</Link> (it's mostly stuff from my high school and college days)

            The above set of images are self portraits from my yearly trip down to the Tidal Basin in Washington DC to see the Cherry Blossoms. I rarely take photos of myself but on one visit I decided it was such a nice morning that I should take a photo to remember it. Since then I've continued the tradition, regardless if the mornings are nice or kind of drab.

However, I've decided I'm going to continue on even if the tree dies.",

This whole section was roped off by the park service (they had just removed the tree I mentioned in Year 3) and I briefly thought of discontinuing the tradition, but it seemed like a shame to kill it off so unceremoniously so I stepped over the ropes and quickly took this shot. Thankfully I didn't get in trouble.",

It was a nice morning and I saw the spot again and was like \"I'm doing it!\" My only regret is that I framed the shot to include the dying tree that's almost directly behind me (in Year 5 you can see this tree's stump behind me - they removed it prior to Year 4's blossoms). This may be the best year for the main tree's blossoms. After Year 4 this tree starts to decline (though maybe it'll make a come back?).",

      'Year 1 (2016): Technically this was my second year in a row visiting the Cherry Blossoms, but it was the first where I really knew what I was doing photography-wise and it was a really nice morning. My best shots of the area are from this day. Anyway, it was so nice I decided to do a self portrait next to the branches of this one particular tree.',

          My name is Pat, I'm a software developer and amateur photographer. I
          setup this site to show off some of my favorite photos. If you're

          The above set of images are self portraits from my yearly trip down to
          the Tidal Basin in Washington DC to see the Cherry Blossoms. I rarely
          take photos of myself but on one visit I decided it was such a nice
          morning that I should take a photo to remember it. Since then I've
          continued the tradition, regardless if the mornings are nice or kind
          of drab.

          Don't DM me on social media, I don't read those and usually only see
          them months later.

        <h4>What kind of camera do you use?</h4>
        <p>Post-2018, Nikon D850. Before that: Nikon D5300.</p>
        <h4>Favorite lens?</h4>
        <p>
          The 24-70mm 2.8/f is the most practical, but I've grown to love the
          70-200mm 2.8/f the most. The depth of field, compression, colors -
          just everything about it is great. However, after reviewing what I
          selected for this site, not a single shot was done with the 70-200mm.
          In fact, all but 6 were done with the 24-70mm. And those 6 were from
          my ultra wide 14-24mm - and they were main gallery images. Maybe that
          lens is secretly my favorite? I don't use it that often, but I seem to
          like the shots I take with it.

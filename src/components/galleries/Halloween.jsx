        <p>
          I've always been a big fan of Halloween. I usually keep my camera with
          me and sometimes when I see a really decked out house I'll stop and
          take a picture. This page is a collection of the best houses I've seen
          so far.

        The above house is mine from 2023. I decided to get in on the fun after
        photographing a number of these types of houses. If you click the switch
        you can see what it looks like during the day. I think it would be cool
        to do more houses like this.

        The most important part of any display is the lights. Not something you
        think about for Halloween, but without them you can't see anything.

        For the above shot, the guy's flood lights came on right after I
        finished taking the shot. I was like "oh shit, this guy is not cool with
        this" â€” but he ended up being pretty flattered and even offered to turn
        everything back on (apparently he was doing a test run and didn't even
        see me until the lights went on).

        Sadly finding these houses is kind of hard. At least really good ones
        worth displaying here. I hope to find some more good ones as time goes
        on.

          (there are 20+ more images there). I decided to save this page for
          displaying the best of the best. Hopefully with each passing Halloween
          I can add some more to both galleries. Until then, if you like these
          kinds of photos check out my{' '}

          It's (unsurprisingly) a lot easier to find really cool Christmas
          displays.

When I came across this pier I could tell there was a nice photo just waiting to be captured. All that was needed was a morning with little to no wind (so the water would be smooth) and a nice sunrise. However, after showing up a few times over the course of a few months, I realized that since the pier pointed north (meaning the sun rose off camera to the right), it would take an epic sunrise/sunset that lit up the whole sky to create the shot I had in mind.',

When I got to the park the following morning I saw the sight you see in the second picture (when you click the toggle button). It was a dreary, unpleasant sight and there was trash everywhere. I was defeated. Why was I punishing myself like this? There\'s no shot here, and even if there was, no one cares about this park, everyone\'s always leaving their trash everywhere.

			"A view of Baltimore's skyline from 2018. I took a series of images as the sun set and found I liked the city lights better an hour after sunrset, but the sky from around 10 minutes after sunset. I took the two images and overlaid them in photostop and was able to blend them into one. However, I had fun toggling the effect on and off because it looked like I was powering on/off the city. ",

My shoes actually came off as I tried to escape. I would later vigorously¬†wash them, but they were never the same.¬†",
			"Also, just off frame was the crazy amount of trash that had washed up on the shore (an old tire, one of those orange¬†barrels they put on the road, etc etc). This inlet is off the beaten trial and kind of hard to get to, which is probably why it was so unkept."

			"I think most people look at this shot and just kind of shrug, thinking of it as just another sunrise pier photo. But I spent over a year trying to get this shot. When I came across this pier I could tell there was a nice photo just waiting to be captured. All that was needed was a morning with little to no wind (so the water would be smooth) and a nice sunrise. However, after showing up a few times over the course of a few months, I realized that since the pier pointed north (meaning the sun rose off camera to the right), it would take an epic sunrise/sunset that lit up the whole sky to create the shot I had in mind.",
			"I spent several months trying to figure out when the best day would be. Over a dozen times I woke up early and drove down to the park, only to be rewarded with a very \"meh\" shot. Finally one night there was a storm and I was sure a great sunrise was waiting on the other side of it. When I got to the park the following morning I saw the sight you see in the second picture (when you click the \"Next\" button). It was a dreary, unpleasant sight and there was trash everywhere. I was defeated. Why am I punishing myself like this? There's no shot here, and even if there was, no one cares about this park, everyone's always leaving their trash everywhere. I went home and tried to forget about this place.",
			"Almost exactly a year later I awoke from my sleep thinking about this shot. It was still dark outside and I figured since I hadn't been there in a while I might as well give it one more try. When I got to the park I was met with the view you saw in the first image. It was completely unreal.",
			"Now, to be clear, I don't think I was divinely woken up to go take this photo, but it's one of those weird coincidences that sticks in the mind. There's also probably a moral in here about not giving up and being open to giving something another chance, or maybe even just listening to your gut. My first instincts were correct, a nice shot was possible, the place just needed the right lighting (and also for the trash to be picked up, which thankfully some did)."

Most of these books are just gibberish, but within the library every single human thought, story, and idea is captured. In fact, within the library there must exist a book which is a perfect index of the library's contents (and also many which are fake indexes). The librarians who inhabit the place are in a state of despair, and many seek to purify the library by destroying the books which are gibbish. Anyway, whenever I think of that story, I think of this place, the George Peabody Library in Baltimore."

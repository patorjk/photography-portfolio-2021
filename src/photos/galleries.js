              A liminal space is a place between "states of being" that feels unsettling yet familiar.
              Typically liminal spaces are of abandoned or empty settings that normally have people in them â€”
              a park after dark, an empty office, a long hallway.
              There's a transitional nature to them.
              They're a snapshot of the time between "what was" and "what's next".

              Another interesting fact about McCloud is that the town's water comes from the Konwakiton Glacier.
              Some hippies and mystics believe the water has special powers and will come from miles around to get
              jugs of it to take home with them. I can't say if its magical or not, but it does taste good.

              About 15 years ago Nestle got wind of this water supply and swooped in to buy it up. In classic super
              villain fashion the town was going to get a terrible deal and Nestle was going to be able to suck up
              all of their water. As an example of the company's douchebaggery, they promised the townsfolk that their
              water plant would bring jobs to the town, but after looking into this it was discovered that the plant
              would mostly be automated and that it would only bring <strong>2</strong> jobs to the area.

              though, and I imagine other vultures will circle in and try to get at their water one day.
